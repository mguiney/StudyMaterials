# StudyMaterials
Study guides and materials I have generated for my classes and decided to share.

      	  * created to help me study for the fall 2018 cs 250 taught by Mocas
      	  * Mostly just copied from her slides, but in more readable form
  * physics
    * 222- class notes and other study materials from phys 222 winter 2019 with butenhoff
      * lecture\_\*.pdf: daily lecture notes. Good for catching up on a missed class or two.
      * cumulative\_notes.pdf: same content as the daily lecture notes, condensed into on megadoc. Good for exam study.
